# slimzonnehuis
a project that calculates when to use what household apleances to optimize the use of solar power.
this is an assingnment for a project done by the second year of engeneering science at the kul in the first semester.
for simulations run the code in test simulation.
for actual every day use see the gui.
gui to be added in seperated directory.
for this system to actually work it has to be linked to a hardware system which monitors electricity usage and that can control it. 
also the program has to be linked to wheater predictions about the irradiance of the sun and the temperature.
the heating methods are completly written the only thing needed is to fill in the properties of the heating system,
the properties of the isolation and properly import temprature predictions
the Excel files give the result of a simulation with the year averages (excluding heating because these files weren't provided)

special thanks to energy ville for providing test data
