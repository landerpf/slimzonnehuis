a project that calculate when to use what household apleances to optimize the use of solar power
this a assingnment for a project done by the second year of engeneering science at the kul in the first semester
for simulations run the in test simulation
for actual every day use see the gui
gui to be added in seperated directory
for this system to actually work it has to be linked to a hardware system whch monitors elecctricity usage and that can control it 
also the program has to be linked to wheater predictions about the irradiance of the sun and the temperature
the heating methods are completly written the only thing needed is to fill in the properties of the heating sytem
,the properties of the isolation and properly import temprature predictions
the Excel files give the result of a simulation with the year averages (excluding heating because these files weren't provided)
